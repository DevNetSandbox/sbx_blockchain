# Hyperledger fabric

This project provides several useful Docker-Compose script to help quickly bootup a Hyperledger Fabric network, and do simple testing with deploy, invoke and query transactions.

Currently we support Hyperledger Fabric v0.6 and v1.0.

## Hyperledger Fabric v0.6

See [Fabric v0.6](0.6/).

Note: Blockchain Explorer (BE) is only working against 0.6, not for 1.0

## Hyperledger Fabric v1.0
See [Fabric v1.0](1.0/).
